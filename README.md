# react-portfolio

## Description

I created this website to exhibit my coding work. 

## Usage

This website displays my work, includes biographical information, and contact information. To view my bio, work, contact information, and resume, use the top navigation bar. Click on each project to view the work I have created as I learn to code. Use the footer nav bar to contact me via phone, email, github, linkedIn, or Instagram
